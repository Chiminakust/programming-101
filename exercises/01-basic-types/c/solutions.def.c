/*
 * 1.1 Create two functions named addi and addf that takes 2 arguements and return the
 * sum of the two. The addi function works with integers and the addf function with
 * floating point numbers.
 */

/*
 * 1.2 Create a function named is_even that takes an integer argument and returns
 * whether or not the number is even.
 */

/*
 * 1.3 Create a function called powerf that returns the power of x to y.
 * All arguments and return types are floating point number.
 */

/*
 * 1.4 Create a function called factorial that returns the factorial of an integer.
 */

/*
 * 1.5 Maclaurin series of sin(x) and cos(x) to any Nth degree (check wikipedia).
 * Takes a float as argument and returns a float. Other arguments left as exercise.
 * Functions must be named maclaurin_sin and maclaurin_cos.
 */

/*
 * 1.6 Create a function called fib that returns the Nth term of the fibonacci sequence.
 */

/*
 * 1.7 Create a function called string_to_int that converts a string to an integer value.
 * The function takes a string as argument and returns an int.
 */

/*
 * 1.8 Create a function called int_to_string that converts an int
 * to its string representation. The function can modify an input argument
 * and return an error code or return the string.
